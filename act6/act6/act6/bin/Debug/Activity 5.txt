Adler Checksum

Create a program to read a paragraph from a file and display the Adler-32 checksum value for that 
string in a label.  It should be in the form of a hexadecimal number. If you were to input the string, 
Wikipedia, the result would be 11E60398.  You can test with that to ensure you are doing an accurate 
calculation.  You can also test with the text file on ANGEL.  It should yield an adler number of FB8F02. 
When reading the file, you don’t need to create a filestream. Use File.ReadAllText(filename);  That way, 
you will pick up the end of line characters.
Your application should consist of a Form and an Adler32 class to which you pass the text on which to 
calculate the check sum.   Use long for the numeric variables in the class, because the numbers may be 
larger than an int is capable of holding.  
Look up the  Adler-32 algorithm on the web. Wikipedia has a rather good explanation.

There is a zip file containing several files in the Lecture 6 folder that you can test with.
