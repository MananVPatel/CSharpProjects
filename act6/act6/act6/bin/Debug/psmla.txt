The following members were absent:  Mina Levenson and Katie Lumley-Pohl.

Approval of minutes from the spring meeting was done via e-mail.

Treasurer’s Report (D. Wills)
Debbie explained that the external audit was done by an accountant from her church.  The auditor explained that everything was accounted for and that his recommendation of having a check approval process was working well.  We had followed his suggestions and he found no problems or concerns.  The fee for the audit was $150.
On a Ballew/Puhala motion, council accepted the report. 

Secretary’s Report (P. Rzodkiewicz)
  Phyllis reported that the 3-year membership option had worked well.  We currently have 515 members and 26 Institutional members.  This number will continue to go up with the conference soon.  It was suggested that we buy stamps for two years since postage is going up again.  
  Debbie showed the beautiful banners that she purchased for use at the conference.  The cost was $600.  We might eventually keep one in the east and one in the western part of the state, but both will be used at the conference in October.
Council voted to approve the report on a White/Wills motion.

Advertising Manager’s Report (R. Hall)
Bob presented his detailed report on the ads for the 2010 PSMLA Forum and for exhibitors and ads for the brochure for the conference.  He explained that the number of tables for the conference is subject to change with a month until the conference.
The report was approved on an Rzodkiewicz/Richards motion.  



Website Manager’s Report (R. DelPorto)
Ron explained that as of two days ago, the website was changed over.  Everyone agreed that the website looks wonderful.  Council was reminded that it is important that they send Ron updates for the website on a regular basis.  A form was developed for members to fill out when something is given to Ron so he knows where it is to be placed on the website and the length of time it should be there.  This will be a great help in maintaining the site.  The PSMLA logo was changed and this will be sent to Frank to be used with ACTFL.  The logo will also be housed on the Ex Co only section of the website for those who need access to the logo.
Council voted to accept the report on a Wills/Rzodkiewicz motion.

10:00-12:00 – Committee meetings:  Advocacy, Publications, Finance, Awards, Membership, Nominations and Professional Development
The committees met and re-examined their goals, making necessary revisions.  Committees also reviewed their area of the website and let Ron know about any necessary changes.  They prepared a report for later during the weekend.  The reports were to be sent to electronically to Phyllis.

12:15-2:30  Several committees met over a working lunch.  The 2011 Conference Committee met with the local committee to begin planning the conference.  Other ExCo members worked on a review of the website, based on recommendations by the Publications Committee.  

Organizational Reports
PDE – (P. Kolega)
  Pam explained that the Curriculum Framework for World Languages is 2/3’s complete on the PDE website:  www.education.state.pa.us under Standards Aligned Systems.  She explained that we are included with al the State Tested and Local Tested content areas.  
A committee will continue to work on the SAS Portal for world languages. 
  A meeting will be arranged between Thomasina, Maryanne, and Pam and the new State Board Chair (J. Torsella) on a weekend.  Thomasina is arranging the date.  The group will also try to meet with Sate REP Vanessa Brown who has a new Bill to override the State Board to approve updated World Language Standards.

Act  48 (J. Stewart)
Jan explained that we were contacted on June 25 that our provider status for Act 48 would expire on June 30.  Jan submitted the paperwork under the new guidelines.  Our proposal was rejected and our status was withheld.  Jan, with the help of council, submitted another request.  We are waiting to hear from PDE.  We are grandfathered, so once our status is reinstated, we can go back and input the hours into the system.  We hope to have this resolved before the fall conference. The biggest change is the focus on student impact.  For the conference evaluations, we have added a section on student impact.  Sister explained to council that at the Governor’s Institute, attendees were given a take home assignment and they were asked to implement strategies gained through the workshops.  This would show how they would implement what they had learned in their classroom.  Minimal time was added for returning the Act 48 form.  ACTFL is doing the same thing.  Susanne Nimmrichter and Nancy Smith have agreed to help Jan with Act 48.  



ACTFL (F. Mulhern)
  Frank explained that ACTFL has developed a series of position statements over the years and would like endorsement from PSMLA for our website, with the approval of Council.  
  PSMLA will donate $1500 and sponsor the Presidential reception for Dr. Eileen Glisan at the ACTFL conference in Boston in November 2010.  The following statements were endorsed by the PSMLA Executive Council:  1) Acknowledgment of PSMLA sponsorship on all communication and signage.  This will include use of the PSMLA logo where possible; 2) Invitations to the PSMLA council members and to those registering for the ACTFL conference in Philadelphia in 2012 at the close of the pre-registration period, October 14, 2012; and 3) PSMLA will co-sponsor the ACTFL 2012 Annual Meeting in Philadelphia.
  The following ACTFL Position Statements were discussed and endorsed by PMSLA on a Rzodkiewcz/Bailey motion:  
1) Since the goal of a standards-based language program is to develop students’ ability to communicate, there must be opportunities for frequent and meaningful student-to-teacher and student-to-student interaction, monitored practice, and individual feedback during instructional time.  Therefore, ACTFL supports the recommended class size of no more than 15 students, made by both the National Education Association (NEA) and the Association of Departments of Foreign Languages (ADFL).  Where larger class sizes exist, teachers must be provided with additional support in order to maintain sound pedagogical practices. 
2) Research indicates that effective language instruction must provide significant levels of meaningful communication and interactive feedback in the target language in order for students to develop language and cultural proficiency.  ACTFL recommends that language educators and their students use the target language as exclusively as possible (90% plus) at all levels of instruction during instructional time and, when feasible, beyond the classroom.
3) ACTFL and its members encourage learning environments that support heritage and native speakers of languages other than English.  It is critical that these students be able to continue to develop their heritage linguistic and cultural skills in order to become fully bilingual and biliterate in today’s global environment.
  The complete position statements can be found on the PSMLA and on the ACTFL websites.  These can be used with parents, students, etc.  These will be sent to PSMLA members via the list serv.

CCA  - (D. Wills)
Deb Wills reported that CCA is ready to start the competition this year.  They did a workshop on sustainability and students received a certificate of participation.  This year there will be a regular competition, the country is India.  Competition will be held the first week of May at the University of Pittsburgh.  PSMLA will support CCA with a gift of $1000 toward dictionaries that are given to the students, field trips for students, and mentors from universities to work with the students, and bus scholarship money for participating schools.  
Council approved to accept these Organizational Reports on an Irish/Richards motion.

2:15-3:30 Continuation of the Organizational Representative reports, begin Standing Committee reports, based on morning meetings and e-mailed reports
JNCL – (T.White)
Thomasina sent out her report on May 10.  There were 3 major concerns:  1) Adequate federal support for languages and international programs and that the Flap Grant remain available; 2) The need for lengthy learning sequences and foreign language education partnerships; and 3) There needs to be continuous funding for foreign language education.    We are lucky in PA to have Senator Casey who is very pro language.  He is dedicated to finding money for foreign languages.  There is a focus committee that is upset that the committee says that in the world language classroom, teachers are not guiding students to become communicative. 

NECTFL – (N. Puhala)
NECTFL is moving to Baltimore this year on April 2-4.  Discussion centered on how to get more people to apply for the Mead Fellowship.  There was discussion that perhaps having a mentor to help with the proposal would generate more interest.  Perhaps we could give a small stipend to help with materials and to help offset the costs.  It was decided that for this year, we would not provide money for the mentor.   A motion was made to provide reimbursement up to $250 for materials for any person whose proposal was selected by NECTFL.  Receipts must be provided.    Council felt it was worth trying this to see if more people would submit a proposal.  

PaCIE – (Sister Mary Helen)
Sister Mary Helen Kashuba will again represent PSMLA at the PaCIE conference in Scranton on September 30 – October 2.  The post conference workshop will focus on how to be safe and secure when traveling abroad.  Some topics for the conference include:  finding money for scholarships, Teachers Without Borders in Africa, etc.

Conference 2010—Erie -  (P. Rzodkiewicz)
The theme of this year’s conference is:  Languages are Eriesistible.  Dave Kinman is doing a pre-conference workshop.  Dr. Eileen Glisan is delivering the Keynote on Friday.  John DeMado is doing a general session on Saturday.  One of the suggestions from last year’s conference in Gettysburg was to have a few sessions on learning another language.  Therefore we sent out the request and have two sessions that will provide a Glimpse at a Less Commonly Taught Language.  Both Slovenian and Chinese will be offered at the Erie conference.  We are again at the Ambassador Banquet and Conference Center on October 14-16.

Conference 2011--State College – (M. Boettjer)
Maryanne reminded Council members that their attendance is expected at the fall conference, for both days, from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon.  Calper will provide two half-day workshops and will have a table with complimentary materials for teachers.  Calper will also help find grad students to help man the tables.  Mimi Met will deliver the keynote.  

Awards – (Sister Mary Helen)
   The Awards Committee nominated the Erie City School District as a recipient for a Merit Award.  They have a Fles program that has gone beyond the period of the Flap grant and have expanded the program to other schools.  They also nominated Bradford County School District to receive a Merit Award.  They have a Fles program and have introduced Chinese.  They use their accountability grant money for world languages.  They have developed this program while other districts are eliminating Fles programs.  
  The Awards committee also nominated Al Kipa to receive the Post Secondary, Educator of the Year Award.  He is a Life Member of PSMLA and a past president. He has done much for language education, and has worked at Muhlenberg College.  
   The committee proposed a new award:  the PSMLA Leadership in World Languages Award.  This award will recognize the exemplary work of an individual who has:  1) Provided outstanding leadership in the foreign language profession in the state, region, and/or nation; and 2) Contributed significantly to the work of PSMLA.  The recipient must have been a member of PSMLA for a minimum of ten years and must still be active in the work for which the award is being given.  The Award is not meant to replace the Educator of the Year Award, nor is it a career achievement award – but the focus is leadership, above and beyond all other PSMLA Awards.  The award does not have to be given annually.  Members at the PSMLA 2010 Conference in Erie will vote on accepting the Award.

Finance – (T. White)
  Council was reminded that all budgets for Professional Development workshops are due two months prior to the workshop.  All honorarium and presenter fees should be paid on the day of the event.  All receipts are due within two weeks.  To be eligible for a refund for workshops and the conference, cancellations must be made prior to the registration deadline.   
  The Finance Committee recommended that PSMLA double the amount of the award for the Outstanding Seniors.  The nominating school and/or teacher must have been a member of PSMLA prior to March 1 of the year of submission of the application in order for the student to be eligible for an award.  The Chair of the Awards Committee needs to check with the Membership chair to make sure the teachers and/or schools are members of PSMLA.

Membership – (P. Rzodkiewicz)
Last year we did the 3-year membership deal and over 70 members took advantage of the offer.  The Regional workshops are helping to increase membership but we need to find a way to make those who attend a Regional workshop want to renew their membership for the next year. 



Nominations/Elections – (D. Richards)
Doug Wolfe resigned and Drew Richards took over nominations.  The following persons are running for three three-year positions and one two-year position.  The following slate was approved on a Richards/Rzodkiewicz motion:  C. Ballew, B. Buxareo, M. Levenson, J. Ricardo-Osorio, and N. Zimmerman.  Once elections are held, Drew will contact people and encourage them to attend the conference. 

Publications  
Rochele will develop forms to help make it easier to submit proposals, etc.  Council also discussed putting something in the Forum about the author.  Those chosen to be published will complete a biography summary.  Rochele will have a separate e-mail for the Forum and this will keep information for submissions separate from regular e-mail.  A PDF of the Forum will be located on the website in the members only section.  A form for submissions will also be located on the website.  The website will also include links to our partner organizations like ACTFL, NECTFL, PaCIE, PDE, JNCL, CCA, etc.  The nominations and publications reports were approved on a motion by Wills/Bailey.  

Regional Projects
Members met by region to discuss projects and workshops for the coming year.  Debbie Wills reported that one of the teachers from Franklin Regional would be presenting a cooking workshop in March.

Upcoming Meetings
On a Boettjer/White motion, the spring PSMLA Executive Council meeting will again be held at the PennStater on April 9 and 10, 2011.  The meeting was adjourned at 4:30 pm.

Sunday, September 12, 2010

The following members were in attendance:  Adam Bailey, Colette Ballew, Ron DelPorto, Robert Hall, Ellen Irish, Sister Mary Helen Kashuba, Mina Levenson, Frank Mulhern, Susanne Nimmrichter, Natalie Puhala, Rochele Reitlinger, Drew Richards, Phyllis Rzodkiewicz, Jan Stewart, and Thomasina White. 

The following members were absent:  Adam Bailey, Pam Kolega, Katie Lumley-Pohl, and Debbie Wills.

Publications
  Council congratulated Rochele on the job she had done with the Forum.  She will check to see if part of the Forum can be placed on the members only section of the website, if we can keep a portion of the Forum open to the public. For now, the entire Forum will be on the members only section of the website.  Kudos also went out to Ron DelPorto on the new design for the website.  Chairs of committees are asked to go to the website within a few weeks and check the drop-down menu for their topic to make sure everything is accurate and appropriate.  Ron will develop a form so that when something is given to Ron to post on the website, persons will complete the form so Ron knows when it is to be posted and when it is to be taken down.  Susanne and Colette will screen the information for Ron.  A mission statement will be placed on the website.  The publications report was accepted on an Rzodkiewicz/Irish motion.
  Council discussed having a PSMLA Facebook page as a way of communication.  There was mixed feelings about having this page.  Jan volunteered to contact the person who set up the IUP Facebook page before we continue. The goal will be to have people visit the PSMLA website.  After a Stewart/Irish motion and an 8 to 1 vote, council voted to allow Ron and Jan to put up a PSMLA facebook page on a trial basis. This will be evaluated at the spring meeting.  

Standing Committee Reports
Advocacy
Thekla and Nancy have been working on finalizing the Assessment Guide.  On an Rzodkiewicz/Levenson motion, it was voted to give one Assessment Guide to each PSMLA member at no charge. These will be distributed at the fall conference, if they are ready.  Phyllis will check into having these printed by her district.   

JNCL  - (M. Levenson)
PSMLA’s name will be added to ASCD regarding recommendations and foreign language.  There is much legislation going on how this affects us at a lower level. 

PEP – (M. Levenson)
Mina has taken over PEP.  Mina has organized two groups that will meet and review the applications:  East (Sister, Maryanne, Ellen, Frank, Adam and Thomasina) and West (Thekla, Debbie, Phyllis, Mina, Natalie, and Jan).  It was suggested that we recognize the winning schools at the conference.  The schools are listed in this year’s conference brochure and the schools will be announced at the conference.  The winning schools are also posted on the website.  There was some concern in two areas:  quality in-service for private schools and those schools in little districts; and feedback to be provided for those districts not approved.  Mina explained that each school had received an individual response.  Mina will investigate these concerns and report back to Council about any possible changes in PEP.  It was decided that letters will be sent to the schools that won the PEP award, to the point person and to the principal, encouraging them to register at least one of their teachers because their school will receive their awards at the PSMLA conference in the fall.  Schools will be notified by March 10.  Applications will be due the first week in February, like before.  The recipients of the Golden Globe will receive $250, Silver Globe will receive an Institutional Membership for 5 and Bronze Globe will receive an Institutional Membership for 3, and Globe will receive a certificate.  
Council voted to approve the 3 reports on a motion by Ballew/Richards.
